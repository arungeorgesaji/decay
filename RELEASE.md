## Getting Started

1. **Download** the decay binary from this releases page if you're on Linux, otherwise build it yourself(Requires sbcl):
```bash
   sbcl --load src/main.lisp --eval "(save-lisp-and-die \"decay\" :toplevel (lambda () (main *posix-argv*)) :executable t)"
```

2. **Run Examples** to see decay in action
